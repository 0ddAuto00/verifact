# VeriFact Example Scripts

This directory contains runnable example scripts demonstrating how to use VeriFact in various practical scenarios.

## Purpose

The examples in this directory are self-contained, runnable Python scripts that show complete, practical implementations. These differ from the documentation examples in `docs/examples/` which focus on concept explanations with annotated code snippets.

## Contents

Examples include:

- Basic API usage
- Command-line interfaces
- Integration with web frameworks
- Custom pipeline configurations

## Running Examples

Each example includes instructions at the top of the file explaining:

1. Prerequisites
2. Required environment variables
3. Command-line arguments
4. Expected output

## Contributing Examples

If you've created an interesting or useful example of how to use VeriFact, please consider contributing it to this directory following the contribution guidelines in the project root.

For conceptual examples and documentation, contribute to the `docs/examples/` directory instead.
