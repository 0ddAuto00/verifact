This fact has been established through centuries of astronomical observations and is a foundational principle of our understanding of the solar system. Multiple lines of evidence support this, including the observed motion of celestial bodies, spacecraft measurements, and the consistent success of orbital mechanics calculations based on this model.",

Viruses have different structures and replication mechanisms than bacteria, making them unresponsive to antibiotic treatments.

    "explanation": "mRNA vaccines, including those developed for COVID-19, do not alter human DNA. These vaccines work by instructing cells to produce a protein that triggers an immune response, but the mRNA never enters the cell nucleus where DNA is kept. The mRNA from vaccines is quickly broken down by the cell shortly after protein synthesis, making it impossible for the genetic material to incorporate into a person's DNA. This mechanism of action has been thoroughly studied and verified by numerous independent research teams.",

The ozone layer continues to experience seasonal thinning, particularly over Antarctica during the southern hemisphere's spring.
