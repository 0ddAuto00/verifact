# Environment Variable Loading Test Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the results of tests conducted to verify that environment variables are loaded correctly in the VeriFact project.

## Test Results

### Basic Environment Check

The `check_environment.py` script revealed:

- ❌ Several required API keys are not set in the environment
- ✅ All required packages are installed
- ✅ Logging configuration appears to work
- ❌ Database connection fails due to configuration issues

### Environment Variable Loading

The custom `test_env_loading.py` script showed:

- ✅ The `.env` file exists and is found by the application
- ✅ Core API keys are properly loaded (OPENAI_API_KEY, OPENROUTER_API_KEY, SERPER_API_KEY)
- ✅ Database credentials are loaded (SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_KEY)
- ✅ Redis URL is loaded
- ⚠️ Some configuration variables are not set but have defaults (MODEL_TEMPERATURE, MODEL_MAX_TOKENS)
- ⚠️ Agent-specific model configuration is not set but has defaults

### Application Code Environment Access

The `test_env_access.py` script showed:

- ✅ Model settings are properly loaded with defaults
- ✅ Default models are used when not specified in environment
- ✅ API keys are correctly accessed by the application
- ✅ ModelManager successfully initializes
- ⚠️ Some database and Redis modules had import errors, but this is unrelated to environment variable loading

### Focused Model Configuration Test

The `test_model_config.py` script showed:

- ✅ Default parameters are correctly defined
- ✅ Default models are correctly defined
- ✅ Model settings are loaded with defaults when environment variables are not set
- ✅ Model names are resolved with fallbacks to defaults
- ✅ ModelManager instantiates successfully
- ❓ Model-specific configuration shows an issue (temperature is 0.1 despite setting CLAIM_DETECTOR_TEMPERATURE=0.5)

## Issues Identified

1. **Model-specific configuration issue**: The model-specific configuration (e.g., CLAIM_DETECTOR_TEMPERATURE) doesn't seem to override the defaults as expected. This suggests a possible bug in how agent-specific parameters are loaded.

2. **Redis Configuration Warning**: There's a warning about the Redis URL format. The Redis URL needs to start with redis://, rediss://, or unix://.

3. **Missing Key Environment Variables**: While many variables have defaults, the project is missing critical API keys which must be supplied for functionality.

## Conclusion

The environment variable loading mechanism is working correctly overall. The dotenv package successfully loads variables from the `.env` file. Variables with defaults gracefully fall back when not specified in the environment.

One potential issue was identified with model-specific configuration variables not being correctly applied, which should be investigated.

## Recommendations

1. Fix the model-specific configuration issue (investigate why CLAIM_DETECTOR_TEMPERATURE didn't apply)
2. Ensure Redis URL follows the correct format (redis://hostname:port)
3. Create a complete `.env` file based on the `.env-example` template
4. Update documentation to clearly indicate which variables have defaults and which require user values
