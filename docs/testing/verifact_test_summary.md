# VeriFact Testing Report

## Test Summary

This report summarizes the results of end-to-end testing conducted on the VeriFact factchecking platform on **May 20, 2025**. The testing aimed to verify that all components are properly implemented and functioning together.

**Overall Status**: ❌ FAILED

**Test Duration**: 1.56 seconds (limited due to early failures)

## 1. Environment and Configuration Checks

| -------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Python Version       | ✅     | 3.13.2 (required ≥ 3.10)              |
| .env File            | ❌     | Missing .env file                     |

| SERPER_API_KEY       | ❌     | Missing required environment variable |
| SUPABASE_URL         | ❌     | Missing required environment variable |
| SUPABASE_KEY         | ❌     | Missing required environment variable |
| openai Package       | ✅     | Installed                             |
| pydantic Package     | ✅     | Installed                             |
| fastapi Package      | ✅     | Installed                             |
| chainlit Package     | ❌     | Missing required package              |
| supabase Package     | ✅     | Installed                             |
| Docker Configuration | ❌     | Invalid - missing .env file           |

## 2. Component Tests

All component tests failed due to missing OpenAI Agents SDK functionality. This appears to be a versioning issue with the openai package.

| Component      | Status | Details                                |
| -------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------- |
| ClaimDetector  | ❌     | Error: No module named 'openai.agents' |
| EvidenceHunter | ❌     | Error: No module named 'openai.agents' |
| VerdictWriter  | ❌     | Error: No module named 'openai.agents' |

## 3. Integration Tests

| Test          | Status | Details                                |
| ------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------- |
| Full Pipeline | ❌     | Error: No module named 'openai.agents' |

## 4. API Tests

| Test               | Status | Details                                 |
| ------------------ | ------ | --------------------------------------- |
| API Server Running | ❌     | Server not started or not responding    |
| Factcheck Endpoint | ❌     | Not tested due to server unavailability |
| Health Endpoint    | ❌     | Not tested due to server unavailability |
| Batch Endpoint     | ❌     | Not tested due to server unavailability |

## 5. UI Tests

UI tests were not performed due to failure of prerequisite tests.

## 6. System Tests

| Test                  | Status | Details                                 |
| --------------------- | ------ | --------------------------------------- |
| Docker Running        | ❌     | Docker daemon not running               |
| Docker Compose Config | ❌     | Not fully validated - missing .env file |

## 7. Issues Found

1. Missing .env file with required configuration
2. Missing required environment variables:
   - OPENROUTER_API_KEY
   - SERPER_API_KEY
   - SUPABASE_URL
   - SUPABASE_KEY
3. Missing required package: chainlit
4. Docker is installed but not running
5. Docker Compose configuration is invalid (missing .env file)
6. API server is not running
7. Components unable to initialize due to missing 'openai.agents' module

## 8. Recommendations

1. **Environment Setup**:

   - Create a .env file with all required variables (see README.md for reference)
   - Install missing package: `pip install chainlit`

2. **OpenAI SDK Issue**:

   - Investigate compatibility between the current OpenAI package (v1.79.0) and the agent implementation
   - Check if the correct version of OpenAI SDK is specified in requirements
   - Confirm whether a specific version is needed for the agents module

3. **Docker Configuration**:

   - Start Docker Desktop application
   - Ensure Docker daemon is running
   - Create the required .env file to allow docker-compose to validate

4. **API Server**:

   - Start the API server using: `uvicorn src.main:app --reload`
   - Verify the correct port is being used (default: 8000)

5. **Component Tests**:
   - Once OpenAI agents module issue is resolved, run individual component tests to verify functionality

## Next Steps

1. Implement the recommendations above in order
2. Re-run the comprehensive test script (`python3 test_verifact.py`)
3. Once basic components pass, proceed with integration testing
4. Then test the API endpoints
5. Finally, test the complete system deployment with Docker

## Conclusion

The VeriFact platform currently has several configuration and dependency issues that need to be addressed before functional testing can proceed. The most critical issues are the missing .env file and the incompatibility with the OpenAI SDK's agents module.
